one major obstacle

1.
the actual programming does present
one major obstacle.

2.
in this book we are often working with
integers of 60 or more digits
for which we need
to maintain total accuracy.

3.
while high precision subroutines
can be written
they are cumbersome.

4.
in teaching this course
I have used rexx
a little known but highly useful language
developed by ibm.

5.
its a modern structured language
that is extremely simple and ideally suited
to integer calculations.

6.
it can be run on any
ibm compatible machine
from a pc up to a mainframe
and operates with arbitrary precision.

7.
I have translated all the algorithms in this book
into rexx programs
and will gladly send a copy to anyone
who requests it.
